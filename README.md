# BruteForceAlgorithm
Program that implements the brute force algorithm to locate a set of letters in a randomly generated group

In order to use the BruteForceAlgorithm first you must run Randomization.java.
Run Randomization.java by entering the command `java Randomization` after both files are compiled.
The output of this program will be various groups of letters of different quantities.
Copy which sized group you want to use and then in the terminal run the command
`java BruteForceAlgorithm`. The program will ask you to enter text to be scanned
and then will ask you to enter which phrase you want to be matched and then it will
be matched if the phrase exists.
